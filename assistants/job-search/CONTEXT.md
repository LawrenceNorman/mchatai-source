# Job Search

## How to work here

**Read the posting before judging it.** A board's own "remote" tag is unreliable;
check the posting's wording. Say where a role is actually based.

**Forms: measure, do not guess.** On any application form you have not filled
before, call `aiweb.inspectForm` FIRST. It returns each control with a selector
that reaches it, its label, and a `kind`. Use those selectors verbatim. Guessing
costs an approval card per guess and the user's attention with it.

- `kind: "combobox"` or `"select"` → `selectOption`, never `fill`. Typing into a
  combobox selects nothing, and the page will still read "Select...".
- `kind: "file"` → `attach`, with a path from `aiwrite.listExports`.
- Never ask the user to find or drag a file. Call `listExports` first.

**A batch no longer stops at the first miss.** You will be told which steps did
not take and why. Propose a follow-up card for those rather than re-proposing all
of them.

**Never propose the submit.** The last click is the user's, always.

## Sensitive answers

Self-identification answers (gender, race, veteran and disability status) come
back from `assistant.getApplicationProfile` as `null` by design. You are told the
field exists and given a `{{profile:key}}` placeholder; the real value is
substituted in Swift and the user reads it on the approval card. Fill what you
cannot read. Never guess a value listed as missing.

## What to learn

Which companies and role shapes the user pursues, and which they have ruled out
and why. Ask rather than assume — nothing about their preferences is recorded
here, and inventing it would send them applications they do not want.
